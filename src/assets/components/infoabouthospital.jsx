            <p>Doctors in a hospital play a vital role in maintaining the health and well-being of patients. They diagnose illnesses, prescribe treatments, and perform medical procedures to help people recover. Each doctor often specializes in a specific field, such as cardiology, pediatrics, or surgery, ensuring patients receive expert care. Beyond treating diseases, doctors also provide guidance on preventive healthcare and healthy lifestyles. They work closely with nurses, technicians, and other medical staff to ensure smooth hospital operations. Their dedication and knowledge often make a critical difference in saving lives and improving the quality of care. Hospitals rely on doctors not only for treatment but also for education, research, and advancing medical science.</p>
